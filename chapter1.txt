There are three people sitting at the bus stop. There is Johnny McPoop, a fly looking guy wearing a
birght green blazer and khaki pants smothered in brown marks. Next to him is Jesse Queefberg who 
is reading a book of poetry. And next to her is Nancy Toot who is wearing a bright green sunday dress. 
Nancy toots lets out a small fart and giggles. 

"It was the dog", Nancy says.
